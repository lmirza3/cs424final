How to Use:
Each Color Represents a frequency: light blue: 700, gray: 850, dark green: 1700, light green: 1900
For more information on each frequency there is a legend on the bottom right which shows which carriers use each frequency.
-	Map: The map shows the GPS data gathered on a walk around the campus. When zoomed in it is easier to tell that there are 
       individual points. When hovering over a point, a sunburst will appear with four sections, to determine what frequency 
       is each section you can look at the next	visualization with the circles, each color has the frequency labeled right under.  
       Each section represents the average decibels for that location for a specific frequency.  
-	Circles: For the next visualization there are four circles, one for each frequency recorded. There is a	slider right under.  
      The slider marker can be moved horizontally to display the data over time. The circles will display the total decibels 
      recorded at the specific time that the slider is at. 
      
Visualization Task:
	The purpose of both the visualizations is to analyze. The map displays the locations where the data was recorded. This 
  is useful because it is easy to see what the data looked by location, an area with more people that are using their phone 
  would mean a higher decibel average than a location where there are no people. The circles shows that same data, but over 
  time not caring about location, it’s the same data as the map, but expanded, not the average.  

Results:
	We were able to notice a pattern, for frequency 700, which is the frequency used by Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon for
  both 3G and 4G is the least one used overall. This is weird because it is the only frequency that is used by all the cellphone 
  carriers, so we expected more usage there. For the rest of the frequencies, in both the sunburst and the display of circles 
  they are all used more than frequency 700.
